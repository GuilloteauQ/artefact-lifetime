#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Setup. Unless otherwise noted, we run our experiments
using a client VM, and a cluster of up to 48 worker VMs. The
client VM is an Azure Standard E8asv4 VMs with 8 vCPUs
(AMD EPYC 7452) and 64GiB of RAM, running Ubuntu 18.04.
Each function worker runs on an Azure Standard D4sv3 with
4 vCPUs (Intel Xeon E5-2673) and 16 GiB of RAM, running
Ubuntu Linux v20.04
